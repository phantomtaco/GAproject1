# Project Diary

Day 1: 8 December 2020

I'm still deciding what to build. I'm trying to choose between the following 4 projects:

    1. A simple drawing application similar to MS Paint
    2. An interactive timeline of my software engineering journey
    3. A simple photo effects app
    4. A joke telling app
    
I think the drawing app will be the most challenging to build, and the photo effects app will be most in line with what I've learned so far in this course. The joke telling app will be fun to make, and the timeline would be a great project that I can keep adding to.
    
I'll post my decision tomorrow! :smile:
