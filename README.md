# GAproject1 Description

My first solo project for the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Flex course.

# Project Diary

Day 1: 8 December 2020

I'm still deciding what to build. I'm trying to choose between the following 4 projects:

    1. A simple drawing application similar to MS Paint
    2. An interactive timeline of my software engineering journey
    3. A simple photo effects app
    4. A joke telling app
    
I think the drawing app will be the most challenging to build, and the photo effects app will be most in line with what I've learned so far in this course. The joke telling app might be fun to make, but the timeline would be a great project that I can keep adding to.
    
I'll post my decision tomorrow! :smile:

Day 2: 9 December 2020

I've decided to build a joke telling app because it will be fun and simple but challenging enough.

Day 3: 10 December 2020

I've been watching videos for inspiration and answers. The following have been useful so far:

Day 3: 11 December 2020

I've been wavering a bit on my decision to build a joke generator after learning more about the project ideas of others in my class but I'm going to stick it out. I've built the HTML for the app and going on to develop the CSS now. Call it procrastinating on the JS part. :tongue:

Day 4: 12 December 2020

COuldn't get the Voice RSS API to work. Making joke display on page instead.

Day 5: 13 December 2020

Sunday - The day of no rest. Still working on both APIs. 

Day 6: 14 December 2020

I found an API that works for me and it seems to be widely used across beginner tutorials so I'll run with it.

Day 7: 15 December 2020

Judgement day has arrived!
